## Overview

### The challenge

  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

#Responsive Layout:
Creating a responsive layout was a challenging task. It required a lot of patience and attention to detail. The website had to be responsive to different screen sizes, and it was important to ensure that the website looked good on all devices. I learned to use media queries, flexbox, and CSS Grid to create a responsive layout.

#React Hook Forms:
I used React Hook Forms for the contact form on the website. It was my first time using it, and I had to spend some time learning it. React Hook Forms helped me to create a simple and clean contact form. It also made form validation easy and efficient.

#Background Positioning:
I had to position the background images in the header section of the website. It was my first time doing this, and I learned how to use background-position to adjust the background image's position. It was a great learning experience.

### Continued development

I have yet to...
üòìHook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry
üòìAdd my own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

### Useful resources

- [How to use React Hook form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oCH5WaJHzk)
- [React Hook Form Resource](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [CSS Positioning: Absolute and Relative explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6UgYq3J3Qs)- had to do a refresher on CSS absolute and relative positioning

üòÆ‚Äçüí® Still need a little bit more of practice to fully grasp absolute and relative positioning but I'm getting there
